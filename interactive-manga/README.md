# LEARN WEB3 NOTES

MangaX is a new age platform using Streamr to experience manga enhanced with generative AI

Check out my video on this here! https://www.loom.com/share/e49913123b114dc8a2b2c7aa7b8e55a1?sid=41064822-33cf-4d2f-96db-25b0fef2be14

To run just use "npm start" as it is a create react app. I started using some Shopify Polaris elements which was super cool. 

Generative AI can take existing and new manga artwork to another level of user engagement. I believe that there are synergies between manga, generative AI, and a constant adaptation of source material. In the demo, I showcase some examples of generative AI and how I believe the platform will allow creative artists to instantly broadcast new material to manga readers, and also incentivize partnerships with the community for AI prompts/models to create the best generative AI product.

MangaX is a platform that streams live-manga to an exclusive audience that subscribes through Streamr from the manga artist.
- Manga readers will be able to experience new art being generated by AI and accepted by the manga artist on a live-basis as new AI art is accepted. This allows readers to be delightfully surprised with each re-read and to increase engagement.
- A smart contract (0xb41D2fb61901dF8662336cB0055EB081170d8e19) facilitates payments automatically to both the manga artist and AI art contributors when a buyer subscribes. The platform manga artist selects artistic pages it wants to partner with AI and the community. This shared ownership and incentive model allows production of a new-tier of manga. 
- AI Contributors come up with the creativity with AI prompts and models and I believe manga readers will value the refresh and uniqueness of AI art as manga is released

How it works:
- Streamr is used to private broadcast from a backend. The front-end showcases Streamr images exclusively based on wallet addresses. 
- Contributors can generate AI and submit them to the manga artist through Streamr. In this demo, I add depth to manga using LeiaPix and showcase the future of how manga can be transformed using generative AI tools like Kaiber. The images are currently saved on Amazon S3 and then sent to the backend 

I love manga and I believe generative AI will enhance the experience of manga readers






# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
